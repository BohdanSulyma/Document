        <p>
          Today the Java language is one of the most widespread and popular
          programming languages. The first version of the language appeared back
          in 1996 in the bowels of Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by
          Oracle. Java was conceived as a universal programming language that
          can be used for various kinds of tasks. And by now the Java language
          has come a long way, with many different versions published. The
          current version is Java 12, which was released in March 2019. And Java
          has evolved from just a universal language into a whole platform and
          ecosystem that unites various technologies used for a range of tasks:
          from creating desktop applications to writing large web portals and
          services. In addition, the Java language is actively used to create
          software for many devices: ordinary PCs, tablets, smartphones and
          mobile phones, and even household appliances. Suffice it to recall the
          popularity of the Android mobile OS, most of the programs for which
          are written in Java.

        <p>his guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
            (WWW).
          </li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</li>
          <li>
            Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one
            of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

        <p>
          A key feature of the Java language is that its code is first
          translated into a special platform-independent bytecode. And then this
          bytecode is executed by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). In this
          respect, Java differs from standard interpreted languages ​​like PHP
          or Perl, whose code is immediately executed by the interpreter. At the
          same time, Java is not a purely compiled language like C or C ++.
        </p>
        <p>
          This architecture provides cross-platform and hardware portability of
          Java programs, so that such programs can be run on various platforms
          without recompilation - Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc. Each platform may
          have its own implementation of the JVM virtual machine, but each of
          them can execute the same code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java is a language with a C-like syntax and is close in this respect
          to C / C ++ and C #. Therefore, if you are familiar with one of these
          languages, it will be easier to master Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another key feature of Java is that it supports automatic garbage
          collection. This means that you do not need to manually free memory
          from previously used objects, as in C ++, since the garbage collector
          will do this automatically for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java is an object oriented language. It supports polymorphism,
          inheritance, static typing. The object-oriented approach allows you to
          solve the problems of building large, but at the same time flexible,
          scalable and extensible applications.

        <p>
          The basic building block of a Java program is a statement. Each
          statement performs some action, such as calling methods, declaring
          variables, and assigning values to them. A semicolon (;) is inserted
          after the statement is completed in Java. This mark indicates to the
          compiler the end of the instruction. For example:
        </p>
        <code> System.out.println("Hello Java!"); </code>
        <p>
          This line represents a call to the System.out.println method that
          prints the string "Hello Java!" To the console. In this case, the
          method call is an instruction and therefore ends with a semicolon.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to individual instructions, a code block is a common
          construction. A block of code contains a set of instructions, it is
          enclosed in curly braces, and the instructions are placed between the
          opening and closing curly braces:
          <code>
            { System.out.println("Hello!"); System.out.println("Welcome to
            Java!"); }
          </code>
          This block of code contains two statements that output a specific line
          to the console.
        </p>

        <p>
          Java is an object-oriented language, so the entire program can be
          thought of as a collection of interacting classes and objects. In the
          first chapter, when creating the first application, the program was
          defined as follows:
        </p>
        <code>
          public class Program{ public static void main (String args[]){
          System.out.println("Hello Java!"); } }
        </code>

        <ul>
          <li>
            That is, the basis of our program is the Program class. When
            defining a class, first comes the <strong>access</strong> modifier,
            which indicates that this class will be available to everyone, that
            is, we can run it from the command line. Next comes the class
            keyword, and then the class name. After the name of the
            <strong>class</strong> , there is a block of code in which the
            contents of the class are located.
          </li>
          <li>
            The entry point to a Java program is the
            <strong>main</strong> method, which is defined in the Program class.
            It is with him that the execution of the program begins. He must be
            present in the program. Moreover, its title can only be as follows:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <code> public static void main (String args[]) </code>
        <p>
          When the application starts, the Java virtual machine looks for a main
          method with a similar header in the main class of the program, and
          when it is found, it starts it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method header is preceded by the public modifier, which indicates
          that the method will be accessible from outside. The word static
          indicates that the main method is static, and the word void indicates
          that it does not return any value. Next, in parentheses, we have the
          method parameters - String args [] is an args array that stores values
          of type String, that is, strings. When starting the program through
          this array, we can transfer various data to the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method header is followed by its block, which contains a set of
          executable instructions.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Comments" class="main-section">
        <header>Comments</header>
        <p>
          The program code may contain comments. Comments allow you to
          understand the meaning of the program, what certain parts of it do.
          When compiled, comments are ignored and have no effect on application
          performance or size.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two types of comments in Java: single-line and multi-line. A
          single line comment is placed on one line after the double slash //. A
          multi-line comment is enclosed between / * comment text * /. It can
          span multiple lines. For example:
        </p>
        <code>
          /* многострочный комментарий Объявление нового класса, который
          содержит код программы */ public class Program{ // начало объявления
          класса Program // определение метода main public static void main
          (String args[]){ // объявление нового метода System.out.println("Hello
          Java!"); // вывод строки на консоль } // конец объявления нового
          метода } // конец объявления класса Program
        </code>
      </section>
    </main>
